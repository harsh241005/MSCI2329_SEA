Findings & Insights from COVID-19 Data Visualization
1. Confirmed Cases (Top 15 Countries)

Countries like the United States, Brazil, India, and Russia have extremely high confirmed case counts compared to the rest of the world.
This indicates a strong skew where a small number of countries account for the majority of global infections.

2. Death Rate Analysis

When considering only countries with more than 1000 cases, several nations show death rates above 10 deaths per 100 cases.
This suggests poor healthcare capacity or late detection of infections.

3. Recovery Rate Analysis

A few countries show very high recovery rates, indicating effective treatment strategies or reporting differences.
Countries with high confirmed cases but low recovery rates may be still in peak outbreak phase.

4. Confirmed vs Deaths Scatter Plot (Log Scale)

There is a clear positive correlation between confirmed cases and deaths.
The log-log plot reveals that higher case numbers almost always lead to proportionally higher deaths, but the slope varies by WHO region.
Regions like Europe and Americas show denser clusters of high values.

5. Active Cases (Top 15 Countries)

Countries with high active cases (e.g., USA, India, Brazil) remain at risk of further spread.
High active cases indicate either slower recovery or ongoing transmission.

6. New Cases vs Total Cases

Countries with high total cases and high new-case rates are likely experiencing ongoing waves or poor containment.
Bubble sizes help identify countries where new cases form a large percentage of all cases.

7. Share of Global Cases & Deaths

Pie and donut charts reveal that a handful of countries contribute a major chunk of global confirmed cases and deaths.
This highlights the uneven geographic distribution of the pandemic.

8. Weekly Growth Rate Distribution

Weekly growth rate density plots show significant regional differences.
Some WHO regions have consistently higher growth, indicating active transmission, while others are stabilizing.
